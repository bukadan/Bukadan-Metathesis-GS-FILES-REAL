I MADE MOST OF MY MAGE LUAs OUT OF SCH LUA FILES, SINCE I DIDNT REALLY CARE FOR GOING TO GET A DIFFERENT ONE.

---F9 is MELEE set TOGGLE (dont really use)
---f10 is PDT set TOGGLE (hit once to activate)
---F11 is MDT set TOGGLE (hit once to activate)
---F12 is CHECK sets (click to see what sets are up)
---ALT + F12 is REMOVE PDT OR MDT SETS 
---F9 toggles MELEE SETS (normal, acc, acc2, acc3, ect , ect) 
---ALT + F9 toggles WS SETS (norma, acc, acc2, mod, ect)


TOGGLE = to get back to "normal" you hit it the number of times there are sets, so if there was say NORMAL, ACC1, ACC2, if you start on normal, and hit it 3 times, itll be back on normal, twice itll be on ACC2, and once and itll be on ACC1.
